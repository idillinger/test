# Scheduled Ride Sharing App

This repository contains a minimal proof of concept for an employee ride sharing service. The focus is on using **free or openâ€‘source** services that operate in **Jordan**.

## Technology Choices

- **Backend:** Node.js with built-in modules. No paid dependencies required.
- **Maps & Routing:** [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) data with routing via [OpenRouteService](https://openrouteservice.org/) or [OSRM](http://project-osrm.org/). These services provide free tiers and cover Jordan.
- **SMS Verification:** [Firebase Phone Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) offers a generous free tier and supports Jordanian numbers.
- **Payments:** [HyperPay](https://www.hyperpay.com/) operates in Jordan and supports card payments. Integration is free; transaction fees apply.

## Development

```
cd server
npm test    # runs basic tests using Node's built-in test runner
npm start   # starts the HTTP server on port 3000
```

### Run Locally

With the server running you can verify it responds:

```
curl http://localhost:3000/
curl http://localhost:3000/trips
```

The current server exposes basic placeholder endpoints for user registration and trip listing. It is intended as a starting point for further development.

## Future Work

- Mobile applications (Flutter or React Native) targeting Android and iOS.
- Secure authentication flow, database persistence, and cost-sharing algorithm.
- Integration with mapping, SMS, and payment providers mentioned above.
